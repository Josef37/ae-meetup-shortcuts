## Thoughts

- Terminal aliases are great
  Especially for "better" commands which are harder to write, i.e. `git push --force-with-lease -> gpf`
- Haven't done, but switch esc and capslock
- Look for shortcut opportunities when doing easy tasks

## General

- Window Management
  - `cmd-tab` and ``cmd-` `` to switch
  - `cmd-n` = new / `cmd-q` = quit
- Desktop/Space Management
  - `ctrl-arrow` = trackpad with three fingers
  - `ctrl-1/2/3/...` (set in settings)
  - Uncheck "rearrange spaces" in "System pref. > Mission control"
- Tab Management
  - `cmd-t` and `cmd-w`
  - `ctrl-tab` or `cmd-opt-[` and `cmd-opt-]`
- General 
  - `cmd-?` = search help/toolbar
  - `cmd-z` and `cmd-shift-z` :)
  - `cmd/opt+arrow/delete` text navigation/editing
  - `cmd-a` select all
  - `cmd-s` save
  - `cmd-x/c/v` cut/copy/paste
  - `cmd-o` open (file)
  - `cmd-r` refresh
  - `cmd-p` print
  - `cmd-f` search
  - `cmd-opt-shift-v` paste without formatting
  - `cmd/opt/shift-click` multi-select
- Slack
  - Has good shortcut support
  - `cmd-up` to edit last message
